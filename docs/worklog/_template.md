Worklog template.

Copy this file to docs/worklog/YYYY-MM-DD-<branch-slug>.md and fill it in
BEFORE opening the PR, committed on the same branch as the change itself.
This branch-specific file count excludes `docs/worklog/_template.md`.

The worklog file is the source of truth for the pull request:
  - PR title       = the `title` field below
  - PR description = everything from "## Request" down
If the scope changes during review, update this file first, then sync the
PR description to match.

Do not include personal data or secrets — worklog files are scanned by
gitleaks like every other file (see .gitleaks.toml).

## Request

<What was asked for, in the requester's intent — not a paraphrase of the
diff. Summarize the original instruction so the context survives outside
the conversation it came from.>

## Changes

<What was changed and why. Include decisions made, alternatives considered
and rejected, and anything a reviewer would otherwise have to reconstruct.>

## Verification

<How the change was verified: hugo build passed, gitleaks scan clean,
affected pages checked locally, etc. Be specific — "it works" is not a
verification.>
